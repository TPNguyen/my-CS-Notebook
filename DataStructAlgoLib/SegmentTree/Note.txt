left and right son will hold the information for the intervals [i, (i+j)/2] and [(i+j)/2+1, j]

Order of growth of segment trees operations
	build_tree: O(N lg(N)) 
	update_tree: O(lg(N + k)) 
	query_tree: O(lg(N + k))
	K = Number of retrieved intervals or segments


Lazy Propagation 
	Sometimes a segment tree operation wouldn't survive if the problem constraints is too large, here it come lazy propagation along with the segment tree.

	In the current version when we update a range, we branch its childs even if the segment is covered within range. In the lazy version we only mark its child that it needs to be updated and update it when needed.
