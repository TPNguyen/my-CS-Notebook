    "### Notes\n",
    "- FB messenger keep all the messages in DB -> can retrieve the messages\n",
    "- Whatsapp delete the message on DB after the receiver receive the messages\n",
    "    + Have end-to-end encryption -> 3rd party cant read the messages\n",
    "- **http Request**\n",
    "    + Request - Response architecture: client request - server response\n",
    "    + Server cant request -> No bidirectional connection \n",
    "    + Not suitable for chat/messaging service\n",
    "- Chat messaging architecture\n",
